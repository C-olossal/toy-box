# toy-box
Denizen scripts for various uses on Minecraft servers!

Toy Box is a space to keep scripts based on fun rather than more internal features. Many of these are as easy as drag and dropping them in to get it started.

These scripts are seperated via different types of quality. Low, medium, and high. I'll try to maintain the medium and high quality scripts.
